<i>A Bevy plugin for creating and managing voxel environments.</i>

## Overview

**Please note that this library is still in Alpha. Expect inconsistent API changes and delayed releases as the library continues to work towards a more stable state.**

Bones³, pronounced *Bones Cubed*, is a voxel-based world manipulation and data storage plugin for [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy). It is designed to store data in an infinite and expandable storage grid in a manner that is useful for both writing ECS-compatible game logic and world management.

### Goals

While this project is easily capable of being used as a foundation for a voxel game engine, that is not its sole purpose. This project aims for a more general-purpose data storage and world generation system to allow for a wider variety of projects with many art styles and gameplay mechanics.

## Installation
This crate can be installed using:
```
cargo add bevy_bones3
```
